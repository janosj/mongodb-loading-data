The pymongo docs are here: https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/pymongo/

To install/uninstall pymongo:
  pip3 uninstall pymongo
  pip3 install pymongo
  pip3 show pymongo

However, note that this won't support the mongdb+srv URIs used by Atlas.
The "dnspython" module must be installed to use mongodb+srv:// URIs. 
To fix this error install pymongo with the srv extra:
 pip3 install "pymongo[srv]"

To install the apachelog parser (from here: https://pypi.org/project/apachelogs/):
  pip3 install --user apachelogs

The Apache log form string is here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html. The data set matches the NCSA extended/combined log format, but the input file has an extra "-" at the end, corresponding to an additional %X in the code.
