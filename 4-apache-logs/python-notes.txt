The pymongo docs are here: https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/pymongo/

To install/uninstall pymongo:
  python3 -m venv demoenv 
  source demoenv/bin/activate
  pip3 install pymongo

The Apache log form string is here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html. The data set matches the NCSA extended/combined log format, but the input file has an extra "-" at the end, corresponding to an additional %X in the code.
